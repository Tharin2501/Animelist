# AnimeList

A sideproject made only for the sole purpose to learn Typescript with React concepts.
Its a classic "fetch data from a API and render the props" type of project.

I haven't had the time to work on this as much as i wanted because of work, but hopefully it will get finished soon.

Note: Not close to done, even the name of the project is under construction.

### TODO

- Context or Redux for passing state through components (unnecessary for a small project like this but want to learn)
- Display description data through props for API with ellipsis followed by read more link to another Details page. (maybe just use react-router here)
